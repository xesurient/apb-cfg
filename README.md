# APB Reloaded Config (APB-CFG)
Everything within this config may or may not be kept up to date with what LO will allow/disallow when it comes to modifying files so when an update to the game is issued, it's always recommended to readd through any patch notes to ensure you're up to date with LO's rules and compliance. 

Older versions whilst still available shouldn't be used unless you know what you want out of them is allowed.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a simple launcher with easy to make changes for the less technically inclined.

# Installation

Go to releases in Github and download the .bat (batch) file listed (you are free to review this file with an AI tool, or yourself), the file is initially small, will ask to confirm that where you have placed it, is where you will keep the config indefinitely as more files from the GitHub repository will be downloaded, once ready, click the corresponding character on your keyboard.

The batch file (launcher) will exit after download has completed, relaunch it to gain options, you will first be asked to specify the drive letter of where APB is installed or optionally you can manual input this path if you have multiple instances of the game.

In the launcher directory, navigate to the config folder and place the relevant files in the same organisation as the 'APB Reloaded' folder structures things.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not run the script as admin as it will store the files in the user's 'temp' directory, deleting all files on closing of the launcher.
> If you do not get the desired outcome then you haven't correctly pointed the launcher to your game and will likely have to retrace your inputted directories.

>[!NOTE]
> When the game has a new update, you will have to run in the 'Update Game' function.

# Remove / Uninstall

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you wish to uninstall the config it is recommended that you navigate to the main 'APB Reloaded' folder wherever that is, be it Gamersfirst or Steam and delete it completely, then find the 'APB Reloaded - Clean' folder in the same directory and rename it to the original folder name, this will delete the modified game and replace it with the clean files that are used for faster updating.
